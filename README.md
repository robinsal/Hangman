# Hangman

This is a project I started in my first year of programming back in high school. At the time it was written very poorly,
with tons of code repeated and no documentation.

Recently, I found this project and touched it up to make it more reasonable. I cut it down from about 800 lines to about 250, and made it much more readable by adding documentation and explanatory comments.

## See the result

If you'd like to run this code and play the game, feel free to clone this repository, and simply navigate to the `bin` folder and run `java HangmanGUI`
